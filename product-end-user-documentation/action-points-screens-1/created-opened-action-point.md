# How to modify the Action Point?

After the Action Point was created, user can see the slightly modified screen. 

Every created AP has the reference number, which can be found in the top left corner of the screen, right under the header.

Also, new section called "Actions Taken" appears under the Action Points Details. This section is required to fill with at least one Action in order to be able to comlete the AP.

Created Action point can be modified, viewed and completed by users with [the corresponding permissions](../untitled/user-roles-and-permissions.md).

## Action Points created in other modules

The Action Points Details screen for the action points that were created in other modules has some differences:

* The corresponding name of module is displayed in the Related app field;
* Related Document field includes link to the task, associated with the Action point.

_Note: for AP created with action points dashboard, Related Document field will be empty._

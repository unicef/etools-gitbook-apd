Here is the overall user interface for the created AP:

Each created AP has the reference number, which can be found in the top left corner of the screen, right under the header.

Also, new section called "**Actions Taken**" appears under the APs Details. This section is required. The user has to fill in at least one Action Taken in order to be able to complete the AP. 

**"Save"** button with the additional option for [completion](how-to-complete-the-action-point.md) is displayed at the bottom of the status panel. 

Created AP can be modified, viewed and completed by users with [the corresponding permissions](../untitled/user-roles-and-permissions.md).

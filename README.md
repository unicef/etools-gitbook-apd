# Action Point Dashboard Documentation

## Documentation Overview

The aim of this documentation is to describe the APD module of eTools.

This documentation has a navigation sidebar on the left of the screen, which can be used to find and open a particular article. Each article also has navigation links at the bottom to move to the next article.

## Design Philosophy of APD

The UX / visual design philosophy builds on [Google Material Design](https://material.io/guidelines/), with variations.

## Technical design of APD

The technical design philosophy for the APD builds on what has already been established by the eTools team at UNICEF. More information here: [https://github.com/unicef/etools](https://github.com/unicef/etools).
